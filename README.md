# Fraud-Detection

# Fraud Detection System

## Overview
The Fraud Detection System is a machine learning-based solution designed to identify and prevent fraudulent activities in financial transactions. The system analyzes transaction data to classify legitimate and fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares data for model training.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracts meaningful features for better predictions.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Uses supervised learning algorithms to detect fraud.
- **Model Evaluation:** Measures accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Real-time Detection:** Identifies fraudulent transactions instantly.
- **Scalability:** Supports large datasets for enterprise-level use.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, TensorFlow/Keras (if deep learning is used)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / MySQL (optional for storage)
- **Deployment:** Flask / FastAPI (for API integration)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fraud-detection.git
   cd fraud-detection
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

## Dataset
- Public datasets like the **Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset (Kaggle)** can be used.
- Ensure data is preprocessed before feeding it into the model.

## Model Training
1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Train the machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks).
4. Evaluate performance using classification metrics.

## API Integration
- The trained model can be deployed using Flask or FastAPI to serve predictions via API endpoints.
- Example request:
   ```json
   {
      "amount": 200.5,
      "location": "New York",
      "transaction_type": "Online",
      "customer_id": 12345
   }
   ```

## Performance Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision & Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC score

## Future Enhancements
- Implement deep learning models for improved accuracy.
- Use real-time streaming frameworks like Apache Kafka for faster detection.
- Develop a dashboard for real-time fraud monitoring.
